                    "Binary search is a 'divide and conquer' algorithm. It goes straight to the middle of the array, and compares the value of the item there (item) to the one it needs to find (itemToFind). If item = itemToFind, it finishes. If item > itemToFind, then it will repeat this process for the left half of the array. If item < itemToFind, it will repeat this process on the right half of the array. \n One thing to note is that binary search REQUIRES a sorted array in order to work (as it can only afford to consider halves if it knows that they will definitively contain the item, which is only true if they are sorted in some order).",

This is recursively performed on the subarrays, which are then pieced back together as 'left + pivot + right'",
